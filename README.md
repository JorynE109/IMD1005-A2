# Assignment 2 - Building Your Website

## Client
My client is Morgan's Magical Emporium, a magician bringing his wares to the world of e-commerce. This site is to be used by wizards looking for good quality, reputable magical wares, and looking to make custom orders for any services Morgan performs such as enchantments, hexes and potions. 

## Changes
As I considered at the end of assignment 1, I changed the design for the buttons for this assignment. I chose a rounded and transparent design, like the popular glass style of various operating systems these days. A resource I used for the style of a glassy button was the following:

## Ai Usage
No generative Ai was used in the making of this project. Any graphics used were acquired from pinterest and confirmed to be human made. 

## Note
For the sake of time I was unable to make full mobile-first responsive design, but I tried media queries to make it somewhat more accessible to differently sized screens.
